# Model
This is for the deployed data science model
## Note:  You must deploy this "Model" folder as its own application
This server is written in python, but the front end GUI is react/node js.  Mixing the buildpacks is a bit tricky, so for simplicity, this app is deployed with CORS allowed (but security enabled as well, matching well established security patterns).  
### Running this server locally
 To run, run the "run.sh" command to start the server
 There's a standalone unit test, request.py, then can be used to check if the python server is running
